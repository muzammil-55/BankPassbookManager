## BANK PASSBOOK MANAGER
This is a simple Python-based passbook system that allows users to record credit and debit transactions with dates and details. It stores all entries in a text file (passbook.txt) and maintains a running balance. Each transaction amount and balance is stored with up to 3 decimal places. Ideal for tracking personal expenses or small-scale finances.
